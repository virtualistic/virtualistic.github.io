A quick note to people who are wondering if you can skip between versions when upgrading to a higher bios version of (in my case) APU2

<!--more-->

## The Answer

YES YOU CAN!
After googling a bit I could not find a definitive answer to this question.
The APU2 was running version **4.12.0.4** and noticed that the latest recommended version was **4.17.x**  source:(https://pcengines.github.io)
So after taking a few deep breaths, I decided to take the plunge and upgrade in one go to 4.17 using PFSense
Recipe:
- Download the required version (4.17.0.3 in my case) from the [pcengines website](https://pcengines.github.io)
- In PFsense make sure you've installed the flashrom package
- ```bash
  pkg install -y flashrom
  ```
- Upload the file through PFSense
- Diagnostics -> Command Prompt, Upload File
- tar -xvf /tmp/apu2_v4.17.0.3.rom.tar.gz to unpack the file
- Create a backup of your pfsense config just to be sure (Diagnostics -> Backup & Restore)
- Under "Execute Shell Command" type:
- ```bash
flashrom -w /tmp/apu2_v4.12.0.3.rom -p internal:boardmismatch=force
```
- After the bios upgrade, shutdown the box, remove the power and after waiting a few seconds, power it back on.
Done!
